This repository is basically about linked lists
a singly linked list's advantaged outweighs that of arrays
in that it allows for easy deletion and insertion.
It is also worthy to note that they are not back to back to eachother in
in memory. Each member of the list is called a node.

A node is divided into two parts. One part has the data structure and
the other the address to the next node.
The HEAD is just a pointer to the first node and the last node is a
pointer to null.
